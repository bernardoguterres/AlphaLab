# AlphaLab Trading Strategies

## Overview

All strategies inherit from `BaseStrategy` and implement:
- `validate_params()` — Verify parameter validity
- `generate_signals(data)` — Produce buy/sell/hold signals
- `required_columns()` — List DataFrame columns needed

Signals are generated at each bar's close and executed on the next bar's open.

## 1. Moving Average Crossover

**File:** `strategies/implementations/moving_average_crossover.py`

**Logic:** Buy when a short-period moving average crosses above a long-period moving average (Golden Cross). Sell on the reverse (Death Cross).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `short_window` | 50 | Short MA period |
| `long_window` | 200 | Long MA period |
| `volume_confirmation` | true | Only signal if volume > 20-day average |
| `volume_avg_period` | 20 | Period for volume average |
| `min_separation_pct` | 1.0 | MAs must be at least 1% apart to signal |
| `cooldown_days` | 5 | Minimum days between signals |

**When to use:**
- Trending markets with sustained directional moves
- Longer timeframes (daily/weekly)
- Stocks with clear trend behavior

**Strengths:** Simple, reliable in strong trends, few false signals with filters.
**Weaknesses:** Lags in fast-moving markets, poor in sideways/choppy conditions.

## 2. RSI Mean Reversion

**File:** `strategies/implementations/rsi_mean_reversion.py`

**Logic:** Buy when RSI drops below the oversold threshold (price likely to bounce). Sell when RSI rises above the overbought threshold. Bollinger Band and ADX filters reduce false signals.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `rsi_period` | 14 | RSI calculation period |
| `oversold` | 30 | RSI level to trigger buy |
| `overbought` | 70 | RSI level to trigger sell |
| `use_bb_confirmation` | true | Require price to touch Bollinger Band |
| `use_adx_filter` | true | Only trade when ADX indicates trending |
| `adx_threshold` | 25 | Minimum ADX for trend confirmation |
| `cooldown_days` | 3 | Minimum days between signals |

**When to use:**
- Range-bound or mean-reverting stocks
- Markets with regular oscillation patterns
- Combined with other indicators for confirmation

**Strengths:** Catches reversals early, works well in oscillating markets.
**Weaknesses:** Dangerous in strong trends (RSI can stay oversold/overbought for extended periods).

## 3. Momentum Breakout

**File:** `strategies/implementations/momentum_breakout.py`

**Logic:** Buy when price breaks above the N-day high with a volume surge (>150% of average) and RSI confirms upward momentum. Sell when price breaks below the N-day low. Uses ATR-based stop losses.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `lookback` | 20 | Period for high/low breakout detection |
| `volume_surge_pct` | 150 | Required volume as % of average |
| `volume_avg_period` | 20 | Period for volume average |
| `rsi_min` | 50 | Minimum RSI for buy signal (confirms momentum) |
| `stop_loss_atr_mult` | 2.0 | Stop loss distance in ATR multiples |
| `cooldown_days` | 5 | Minimum days between signals |

**When to use:**
- Volatile stocks with potential for large moves
- Breakout patterns after consolidation
- Markets with strong volume-price relationships

**Strengths:** Captures large moves early, built-in risk management with ATR stops.
**Weaknesses:** Many false breakouts in choppy markets, requires strong volume for confirmation.

## Adding a New Strategy

1. Create `backend/src/strategies/implementations/your_strategy.py`
2. Inherit from `BaseStrategy`:

```python
from ..base_strategy import BaseStrategy

class YourStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    name = "Your_Strategy"

    def validate_params(self):
        self.params.setdefault("period", 14)
        # Validate...

    def required_columns(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["Close", "RSI"]  # columns your strategy needs

    def generate_signals(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
        signals["signal"] = 0       # 1=buy, -1=sell, 0=hold
        signals["confidence"] = 0.0  # 0-1
        signals["reason"] = ""
        # Your logic here...
        return signals
```

3. Register in `implementations/__init__.py`
4. Add to `STRATEGY_MAP` in `api/routes.py`
5. Add default params to `config.yaml`
6. Write tests and update this doc

## Strategy Comparison Tips

- Use `/api/compare` to run multiple strategies on the same data
- Look at Sharpe ratio for risk-adjusted returns, not just total return
- Check max drawdown — a high-return strategy with 50% drawdown may not be practical
- Run Monte Carlo to see the range of possible outcomes
- Use walk-forward validation to test for overfitting
